        <p>I have had a strange introduction into research - I originally knew I wanted to try out chemistry, but understood that Freshman year courses were nothing like the topics that people were actively exploring for discovering new things. Because of this, I was kind of lost on what I wanted to get into, but knew I wanted to get into some form of scientific exploration. As a result, I initially started 'doing' computational biology with a group of undergrads that my Gen Chem TA hosted. In reality, I just kinda sat there and tried my best to google all of the words I didn't understand.</p>
