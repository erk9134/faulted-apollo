Hi! This website is meant to be a small forum for people to upload whatever they want and communicate without feeling advirtised to or in fear of having their information be lifted or viewed by companies. I was inspired by a class on ethics of internet usage and hope that this can be a space between text messages, but a bit more local than instagram. Not a coder by trade either - let me know what can be added. Okie enjoy!
